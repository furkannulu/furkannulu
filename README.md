Hello, my name is Furkan ULU. I am currently a new graduate Computer Engineer👨🏻‍💻 from Bandirma Onyedi Eylül University. Throughout my university life, I have had the opportunity to explore various fields and programming languages. In the past year, I have been focusing on **Data Science and Computer Vision**. I have gained experience in <br />

**·Machine Learning ,** <br />
**·Deep Learning ,** <br />
    **·PyTorch**<br />
    **·Tensorflow**<br />![tensorflow](https://github.com/furkannulu/furkannulu/assets/63801809/1f93969d-fb19-4bd5-ba03-6d64c7e7c58b)
    **·Keras**<br />
**·Computer Vision**<br />
**·Image Processing**<br />
**·OpenAI Clip**<br />
**·NLP**<br />
**·Data Analysis / ModellIng /<br />**
**·Visualization Tools <br />**
  **·Power BI** <br />

**·SQL**<br />
**·Python<br />**
    **{ Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn<br />**
    **Matplotlib, Plotly,Beautiful Soup,<br />**
    **NLTK, Gensim, WordCloud,<br />**
    **Mediapipe, OpenCV...}<br />**

and I continue to expand my knowledge in this area.

In addition to my university education, I have been participating in specific courses and bootcamps to further enhance my skills. The most notable one among them was the "Yazan Zeka" bootcamp program organized by GMKA and conducted by TRAI.

During the Yazan Zeka training program, the initial modules focused entirely on **Data Analysis** and **Data Modeling**. After completing these modules:

We conducted time series analysis on BIST100 data obtained from Yahoo Finance using Python and web scraping methods to collect data from various sources.
We performed index calculations and dashboard designs by combining the collected data with company sales data provided by TRAI.
We extensively preprocessed the data according to TRAI's company sales data, cleaned and classified it to make it suitable for modeling and analysis, and then performed ad-hoc data analysis using Power BI. This included **profitability KPIs**, **budget-actual-previous year scenario analysis**, and **dashboard designs based on the created scenarios**. We completed this phase by presenting the designs to industry experts. Through this module and my research, I had the opportunity to learn terms and information related to the Finance sector that I was previously unfamiliar with.

In the second module, we received training on **Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing** and are currently working on a project in this area. 
As the final module, we will focus on **Image Processing** and complete the module.

Additionally during my last internship,
I had the opportunity to work on **PyTorch** and **Computer Vision**.
Conducting my internship in a corporate company provided me with valuable experience in **Computer Vision, Deep Learning,
Object Detection, Linking Images and Text with OpenAI CLIP Model and Analyzing with DeepFace, Image to Text**.

After this internship I decided to make a careeer in this industry and being Computer Vision Engineer. So my whole focus these days is on **Computer Vision**.
